# Budget Envelope Express App ðŸ“ŠðŸ’¸

This Express application provides an API for managing budget envelopes.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone git clone https://github.com/2003salar/personal-budget.git
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd personal-budget
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The server will start listening on port 3000 by default. You can access the API endpoints using a tool called Postman. 

## Endpoints
