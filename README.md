# Budget Envelope Express App ðŸ“ŠðŸ’¸

This Express application provides an API for managing budget envelopes.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone git clone https://github.com/2003salar/personal-budget-1.git
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd personal-budget-1
    npm install
    ```
